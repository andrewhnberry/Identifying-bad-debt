# Identifying-bad-debt
A classic end-to-end portfolio Data Science project, using the Lending Club Data

**Project Initialized:** May 4, 2020

#### The Dataset
This dataset is found from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data). It is the lending club loan dataset from 2007 to 2015.

#### Project Goals

For this project, my **main goal is to provide an in depth Exploratory Data Analysis of the data**. I want to leverage my data analytics skills, as well as my data visualization skills. I will be using python as my main language, as well as their visualization plugins such at Matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.

This project is end-to-end, so I will therefore be doing data cleaning, as well as various modeling techniques. As with all my projects, they are iterative. Hope you enjoy and follow along with the ride.
